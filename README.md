# Quantum-simulation-of-Schwinger-model

A lecture and code examples for quntum simulation of the 1+1d QED (Schwinger model) are provided. 
The topics covered in this lecture includes staggard fermiuons, Jordan-Winger transformation, implementation of the massive Schwinger model with topological term and chenical potential. 

You can learn how to prepare the ground state by adiabatic state perapration, simulate a quench process, and compute various physical observables such as chiral condensate.
